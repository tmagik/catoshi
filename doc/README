Copyright (c) 2015 Grantcoin Developers
Distributed under the MIT/X11 software license, see the accompanying
file license.txt or http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php.
This product includes software developed by the OpenSSL Project for use in
the OpenSSL Toolkit (http://www.openssl.org/).  This product includes
cryptographic software written by Eric Young (eay@cryptsoft.com).


Intro
-----
Grantcoin is a free open source project derived from Peercoin (PPCoin),
with the goal of providing a long-term energy-efficient cryptocurrency
which is primarily distributed by the Grantcoin Foundation, a legally
incorporated nonprofit organization, as Proof-of-Participation grants to
support and incentivize sustainable business around the world. Built on
the technological foundations of Bitcoin and Peercoin, Grantcoin adds
organizational innovation to make digital currency serve the cause of
social and environmental responsibility and a fair distribution of wealth.


Setup
-----
Unpack the files into a directory and run:
 bin/32/grantcoin-qt (GUI, 32-bit)
 bin/32/grantcoind (headless, 32-bit)
 bin/64/grantcoin-qt (GUI, 64-bit)
 bin/64/grantcoind (headless, 64-bit)

The software automatically finds other nodes to connect to.  You can
enable Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) with your router/firewall
or forward port 9982 (TCP) to your computer so you can receive
incoming connections.  Grantcoin works without incoming connections,
but allowing incoming connections helps the Grantcoin network.
