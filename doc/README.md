Intro
---------------------
*Coin is a free open source peer-to-peer electronic cash system that is
completely decentralized, without the need for a central server or trusted
parties.  Users hold the crypto keys to their own money and transact directly
with each other, with the help of a P2P network to check for double-spending.

### Unix

You need the Qt4 run-time libraries to run Bitcoin-Qt. On Debian or Ubuntu:

	sudo apt-get install libqtgui4

Unpack the files into a directory and run:

- bin/32/bitcoin-qt (GUI, 32-bit) or bin/32/bitcoind (headless, 32-bit)
- bin/64/bitcoin-qt (GUI, 64-bit) or bin/64/bitcoind (headless, 64-bit)

See the documentation at the [*Coin Wiki](http://bitbucket.org/catoshi/catoshi)
for help and more information.
* Ask for help on [#catoshi](http://webchat.freenode.net?channels=catoshi) on Freenode. If you don't have an IRC client use [webchat here](http://webchat.freenode.net?channels=catoshi).
