Contributing to Bitcoin Core
============================

Cats are arbitrary and capricious creatures.

If you must insist on assuming some sort of intent of the developers, assume that you are a mouse, and everyone else just wants to arbitrarily and capriciously eat you. We can save all the trouble of arguing over 'the good of the project', or other such abstract and lofty ideals and leave us to focus on "Is this code good for ME"

This is a free (as in speech) open source project, and we encourage you, dear reader, to clone the repository and do something interesting with it. What's good for me is for more people to learn how to download a code and create their own blockchain and money.

Some of you readers will decide it's better business (for you) to pay me some of your new money for a support contract than re-discover all the mistakes I've made.

The bravest of you will do this because it is an interesting challenge, not because you get paid for it.

Contributor Workflow
--------------------

Come up with an idea, business case, or marketing plan, and instead of taking or hoarding money like those with little imagination seem to do, make some new money. Premine a blockchain. Distribute basic income to your friends and relatives. Make a blockchain for promoting your business.

If you want other Catoshis to join you in a consensus-based project, show us running code, and keep it simple.

This challenging, at best, to do when developers have a profit-seeking motive to promote a maximalist one chain to rule them all vision because they believe their hoard of shiny coins is somehow of value to everyone who does not have them.

Release Policy
--------------

Each Catoshi is the release manager for their favorite pet currency. 

Ethical Treatment of Currencies
-------------------------------

Consider the ethics and morals involved when creating a new currency. I am not here to tell you what those should be, only that it is probably a good idea to have some, and think and act carefully about how you treat your new pet currency. Mistreated pets may decide to eat you, or if there is a consensus among the people using it, they may decide you are no longer fit to own it, and re-home your precious to a new home.
