Contributing to Catoshi Core
============================

Cats are arbitrary and capricious creatures.

If you must insist on assuming some sort of intent of the developers, assume that you are a mouse, and everyone else just wants to arbitrarily and capriciously eat you. We can save all the trouble of arguing over 'the good of the project', or other such abstract and lofty ideals and leave us to focus on "Is this code good for ME"

This is a free (as in speech) open source project, and we encourage you, dear reader, to clone the repository and do something interesting with it. What's good for me is for more people to learn how to download a code and create their own blockchain and money.

Some of you readers will decide it's better business (for you) to pay me some of your new money for a support contract than re-discover all the mistakes I've made.

The bravest of you will do this because it is an interesting challenge, not because you get paid for it.

Contributor Workflow
--------------------

Come up with an idea, business case, or marketing plan, and instead of taking or hoarding money like those with little imagination seem to do, make some new money. Premine a blockchain. Distribute basic income to your friends and relatives. Make a blockchain for promoting your business.

If you want other Catoshis to join you in a consensus-based project, show us running code, and keep it simple.

This is challenging, at best, to do when developers have a profit-seeking motive to promote a maximalist one chain to rule them all vision because they believe their hoard of shiny coins is somehow of value to everyone who does not have them.

Release Policy
--------------

Each Catoshi is the release manager for their favorite pet currency. 

Ethical Treatment of Currencies
-------------------------------

Consider the ethics and morals involved when creating a new currency. I am not here to tell you what those should be, only that it is probably a good idea to have some, and think and act carefully about how you treat your new pet currency. Mistreated pets may decide to eat you, or if there is a consensus among the people using it, they may decide you are no longer fit to own it, and re-home your precious to a new home.

Copyright Policy
----------------

7 Elements LLC and Troy Benjegerdes are the copyright (bag)-hodlers for Catoshi, and
have to empty the catbox. Therefore you may contribute changes two ways:

	1) under AGPLv3, with a signed copyright assignment
	2) under the CopyCatCoin MIT/BSD/public domain license

If you choose option 1, you must execute and sign a paper copy of the (TBD) copyright
assignment form giving 7 Elements the rights to blatently relicense your AGPLv3
contribution in whatever way we see best fit to keep feeding Catoshi (the cat and
the project), and submit a hash of a scan of said document in a transaction on the
blockchain of your choice supported by Catoshi. If Catoshi, in her arbitrary and
capricious ways, feels you are worthy of cleaning her catbox, she may direct 7
Elements to send some coin to said address.

If you choose option 2, then any other CopyCatCoin can also use your code and we
will promptly do as the license permits and re-license it as AGPLv3.
