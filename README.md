### What is PPCoin?
[PPCoin](http://ppcoin.org/) (abbreviated PPC), also known as Peercoin and Peer-to-Peer Coin is the first known [cryptocurrency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency) based on an implementation of a [combined proof-of-stake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof-of-stake)/[proof-of-work system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof-of-work_system). As of May 24 2013, one PPCoin had a value of approximately 0.21 USD, giving PPCoin a money supply with a value of $4 million USD, making it the third largest cryptocurrency.

Differences from Bitcoin
================================

### Proof of Stake
PPCoin's major difference from Bitcoin is that it uses a proof-of-stake/proof-of-work hybrid system for coin generation. With this system, coins are generated based on proof-of-stake blocks in addition to proof-of-work blocks. Proof-of-stake block generation is based on coins held by individuals. In other words, someone holding 1% of the currency will generate 1% of all proof-of-stake coin blocks.

### Potential for Increased Security
Proof-of-stake block generation could reduce the risk of 51% attacks for at least two reasons. First, the cost of acquiring 51% of all stake could in theory be much higher than the cost of acquiring 51% of all mining power, thus raising the cost of attack. Second, in a 51% stake attack the attacker's investment would be directly at risk of losing value. By contrast, with a 51% mining attack the attacker would still own the mining hardware which could either be sold or used to mine a different cryptocurrency following the attack.

###Energy Efficiency
Proof-of-stake blocks require minimal energy consumption. Thus, with PPCoin energy consumption would decrease over time as proof-of-work blocks become less rewarding and coin generation becomes increasingly based on proof-of-stake block generation.
