Grantcoin Official Development Repo
==================================

### What is Grantcoin?
[Grantcoin](http://www.grantcoin.org/) (abbreviated GRT) is the first [cryptocurrency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency) distributed primarily as Proof-of-Participation grants according to a transparent business plan by a legally incorporated nonprofit organization. Grantcoin is based on [Peercoin](http://peercoin.net/) (PPCoin), the first digital currency using Proof-of-Stake consensus as a security model, which is more energy efficient than [Bitcoin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin)'s Proof-of-Work mining system. Grantcoin will begin with several months of PoW until the currency is widely circulated, followed by a hybrid phase, and then transition completely to PoS after the first year.

Repo Guidelines
================================

* Developers work in their own forks, then submit pull requests when they think their feature or bug fix is ready.
* If it is a simple/trivial/non-controversial change, then one of the development team members simply pulls it.
* If it is a more complicated or potentially controversial change, then the change may be discussed in the pull request, or the requester may be asked to start a broader community discussion in the [Grantcoin Forum](http://www.grantcoin.org/forum/). 
* The patch will be accepted if there is broad consensus that it is a good thing. Developers should expect to rework and resubmit patches if they don't match the project's coding conventions (see coding.txt) or are controversial.
* From time to time a pull request will become outdated. If this occurs, and the pull is no longer automatically mergeable; a comment on the pull will be used to issue a warning of closure.  Pull requests closed in this manner will have their corresponding issue labeled 'stagnant'.
