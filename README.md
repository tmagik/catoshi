Grantcoin-Catoshi Development Repo
==================================

### What is Grantcoin?
[Grantcoin](http://www.grantcoin.org/) (abbreviated GRT) is the first [cryptocurrency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency) distributed primarily as Proof-of-Participation grants according to a transparent business plan by a legally incorporated nonprofit organization. Grantcoin is based on [Peercoin](http://peercoin.net/) (PPCoin), the first digital currency using Proof-of-Stake consensus as a security model, which is more energy efficient than [Bitcoin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin)'s Proof-of-Work mining system. Grantcoin will begin with several months of PoW until the currency is widely circulated, with further evolution determined by the foundation and community.
